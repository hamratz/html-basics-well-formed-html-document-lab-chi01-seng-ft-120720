    inside here is where i can put what i want in my body. hahah lol. this could be a paragraph, or a list, like so:
    <li>here</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>my</li>
    <li>list</li>
    it could also be an ordered list, which means it has a numeral value starting with 1 at the top. 
    <ol>
      <li>here</li>
      <li>is</li>
      <li>my</li>
      <li>list</li>
      <li>in</li>
      <li>number</li>
      <li>order</li>
      we could also put hierarchies here and make some text really big and other text really small, and some in between like the Goldilocks principle.
      <h1>Circumstellar habitable zone</h1>
      <h2>also known as the habitable zone</h2>
      <h3>is the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface can support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure.[1][2][3][4][5] The bounds of the CHZ are based on Earth's position in the Solar System and the amount of radiant energy it receives from the Sun. Due to the importance of liquid water to Earth's biosphere, the nature of the CHZ and the objects within it may be instrumental in determining the scope and distribution of planets capable of supporting Earth-like extraterrestrial life and intelligence.</h3>
