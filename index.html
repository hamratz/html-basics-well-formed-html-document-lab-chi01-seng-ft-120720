    inside here is where i can put what i want in my body. hahah lol. this could be a paragraph, or a list, like so:
    <li>here</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>my</li>
    <li>list</li>
    it could also be an ordered list, which means it has a numeral value starting with 1 at the top. 
    <ol>
      <li>here</li>
      <li>is</li>
      <li>my</li>
      <li>list</li>
      <li>in</li>
      <li>number</li>
      <li>order</li>
      we could also put hierarchies here and make some text really big and other text really small, and some in between like the Goldilocks principle.
    </ol>
